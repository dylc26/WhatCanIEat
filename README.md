# WhatCanIEat

<h2>General Info</h2>
<p>For my module one project I wanted to create something that I would use myself. I had recently been forced to change my diet significantly and found that there was no good, free, tool available for the specific things I wanted. This was a great way to challenge myself and try out my new skills learned during module one. </p>
<br>

<h2>Technologies Used</h2>
  <ul>
   <li>HTML5</li>
    <li>CSS, via Bootstrap</li>
   <li>JavaScript (ES6)</li>
   </ul>
<br>

<h2>Core Functionality</h2>
<p>The main function of this project was to create a means of searching for recipe options, but do so by excluding ingredients. For myself to start, but with the scope to potentially help others in the future.</p>
<br>

<h2>Future Plans</h2>
 <ul>
  <li>Additional functionality to save recipes</li>
  <li>Add user accounts</li>
  <li>Save excuded ingredients lists for faster searching</li>
  <li>Save past searches/recipes</li>
  <li>Rating system</li>
 </ul>
